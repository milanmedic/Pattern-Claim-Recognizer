# Program Description
Simple claim parser program capable of reading text file and recognizing the format of claims by matching against pattern and exposing them in 'fetchable' (JSON) format.

Used for exercising my Golang skills.

# How to Run?
Just use `chmod +x compile.sh` to create an executable shell script.
Then run `./compile.sh`.
After that run `./main`.
